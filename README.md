# Smart Irrigation System

## Overview
The Smart Irrigation System is an IoT-based solution designed to optimize water usage and enhance crop yield by automating irrigation control and providing real-time sensor data.

## Features

1. **Operating Modes**
   - **Manual Mode**: Allows manual control of the irrigation system.
   - **Automatic Mode**: Enables automatic irrigation based on sensor data and pre-set conditions.

2. **Mode Switching**
   - Seamless transition between Manual and Automatic modes via the user interface.

3. **History Tracking**
   - Records motor operation status (on/off).
   - Logs which mode triggered the motor operation.
   - Historical data accessible for reference and analysis.

4. **Real-time Sensor Readings**
   - Provides current readings from soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors.

5. **Crop Duration Tracking**
   - Displays days elapsed since crop planting.
   - Helps manage irrigation schedules based on crop growth stages.
